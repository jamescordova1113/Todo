# Todo App

`As a user, I would like a page that lists TODO items. Each item has a description, a due date and a priority. The items in the page should be filterable by description (partial match) or priority.  I may have thousands of TODO items.`

`You may use component libraries on the frontend if you wish..`
`You may use a SQLite file for backend storage or a flat file.`

`Take no more than 2 hours to implement the page. A hard stop at 2 hours is acceptable. The project should be runnable locally.`
